//Findings: Being a child increases the likelihood of survival by 19.5 percentage points relative to being an adult. Being female increased the likelihood of survival by 49.7% percentage points relative to beign male. Being in the first class increased the odds of survival by 31.2 pp and being in the 2nd class increased them by 14.4pp, both relative to being in the 3rd class. In all, women and children were really prioritized in the resque efforts. Social class mattered for survival.  For probit, the odds ofsurviving when female increase by 54pp relative to male. For logit model, the odds of surviving when female increase by 55.3pp relative to male
